\usage{
phr_solution_master_species(element_name, master_species, alkalinity = 0,
  gram_formula_weight = element_gram_formula_weight,
  element_gram_formula_weight = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{element_name}{An element name (e.g., As). Can also have a valence state
(e.g., Hg(2)). If it does have a valence state, the original element must
already be defined as a phr_solution_master_species. This is the name that
will get used to specify concentrations in \code{\link[=phr_solution]{phr_solution()}}. Can be any
name that starts with a capital letter (e.g., "EDTA").}

\item{master_species}{The representative species of the element. This is the
name that will end up in a \code{\link[=phr_solution_species]{phr_solution_species()}} reaction (or any other
reaction).}

\item{alkalinity}{The contribution of this species to Alkalinity.}

\item{gram_formula_weight}{Weight used for unit conversion from the master
species. Usually this is the gram formula weight of the element (safest
bet), not of the dominant aequeous species. The exception of this appears
to be SO4 in the databases. Use NA to calculate automatically; use NULL to
omit.}

\item{element_gram_formula_weight}{Weight used for unit conversion from the
element. Use NA to calculate automatically; use NULL to omit.

\description{
Most master species are defined in the databases. Some are not (e.g., Hg in
the default database), and require specification in the input. This is also a
good way to specify components of a solution that do not dissociate (e.g.,
Cyanide in the minteq database). Solution master species must have an
associated \code{\link[=phr_solution_species]{phr_solution_species()}} identity reaction (e.g., Hg+2 = Hg+2).
The identity reaction must have a log_k of 0, but can specify other
parameters such as gamma (relationship between activity, concentration, and
ionic strength).

# Species that are partially included already are harder to implement.
# To implement a concentration of "Perchlorate" (ClO4-), it's necessary to
# include a balanced reaction to convert the previously defined
# primary master species Cl- to ClO4. Realistically, this would be
# done using Cl2, which could be created using Na+ and Cl-. Basically,
# this is a bit of a rabbit hole. Log K values should be included with any
# non-identity reaction to ensure the result is somewhat realistic. You could
# use very low log_k values to suggest that maybe this reaction is unlikely.
